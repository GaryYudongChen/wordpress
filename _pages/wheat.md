		<p><strong>Temperature</strong>: The monthly average temperature should range between 10°C and 15°C during the period of sowing. The same should be between 21°C and 26°C during ripening period. Wheat grain does not mature fully if the temperature falls below 21°C.</p><p><strong>Rainfall</strong>: Wheat grows better in those areas where rainfall occurs in winter. Areas having 50 to 100 cm annual average rainfall grow wheat. Irrigation serves the best if rainfall falls below 50 cm.</p><p><strong>Soils</strong>: Wheat grows best in well drained fertile loams of either alluvial soils type or black soils type.</p><p><strong>Relief</strong>: Wheat field is gently undulating to arrest water logging.</p><p><strong>HYV</strong>: The HYV of seeds like Larma Rajo, Sonera-6, Kalyan Sona, increase yield per hectare.</p><p> </p>

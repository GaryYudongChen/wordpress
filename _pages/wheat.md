			<h3>ABOUT</h3>		
		<p style="text-align: left;">Wheat is one of Australia’s major crops and Victoria has over 1.5 million hectares dedicated to the cultivation of the crop. Farmers believe that the framework for all winter crop production in Victoria is based on the principles and practice of successful wheat farming.</p>

			<h3>CROP MANAGEMENT</h3>		
			<h3>Soil Type & Suitability</h3>		
		<p style="text-align: left;">It is adapted to a wide range of soil types but highest yield is on well drained soils with a surface and sub-surface soil pH<sub>(CaCl)</sub> of 45 or higher. However, varieties vary in their ability to tolerate low pH and aluminium toxicity.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Crops sown early can develop roots down to a depth of two meters and so the moisture and quality of the sub-soil can be important. Some varieties can tolerate short periods of waterlogging, although this may reduce production</p>		
			<h3>Climatic Conditions</h3>		
		<p style="text-align: left;">A suitable rainfall event is required for sowing as rainfall just before, and during the growing season is the main contributing source of water for a crop. Water stored in the soil at the time of sowing, from pre-season rainfall, is also an important available water source and so rainfall patterns are an essential consideration for production. However, in some areas irrigation is used to supplement rainfall.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Wheat germination requires temperatures ideally between 12°C and 25°C, however germination will still occur between 4°C and 37°C. Germination will occur more quickly with consecutive warm days.</p>		
			<h3>Seeding Rate</h3>		
		<p style="text-align: left;">To achieve total ground cover and establish the foundation for maximum yield, a crop density of 150-200 plants per square metre is needed. This equates to a seeding rate of about 60kg/ha in lower rainfall zones (up to 400mm annual rainfall) and about 80-90kg/ha in the higher rainfall zones.</p>		
			<h3>Nutrition</h3>		
		<ul><li style="text-align: left;">Potassium (K): The critical range for Colwell K is 32-52mg/kg for sandy soils, 45-52mg/kg for sandy loams and 35-45mg/kg for duplex soils. Top dressing can generally correct a deficiency in the crop.</li><li>Phosphorus (P): Check soils P status as maintenance rates at seeding may only be required.</li><li>Nitrogen (N): Develop the nitrogen strategy by considering the crops potential yield, soil test results and other rotational, soil type and rainfall information. Nitrogen can be applied upfront at seeding (separated from the seed) or split with post emergence applications.</li><li>Micro nutrients: Monitor the crop within the season and tissue test to identify deficiencies to micro nutrients.</li></ul>		
			<h3>DiSeases</h3>		
		<p style="text-align: left;">Some of the main pests and diseases responsible for the majority of losses in wheat production in Australia include: yellow leaf spot; stripe rust; septoria nodorum blotch; crown rot; and <i>Pratylenchus neglectus</i>. Other diseases include Rhizoctonia barepatch, cereal cyst nematode, <i>Pratylenchus thornii</i>., common bunt,  stem rust, leaf rust, barley yellow dwarf virus, and wheat streak mosaic virus.</p>

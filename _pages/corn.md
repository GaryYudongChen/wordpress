<h4>Site and soil</h4>
The site should be open and sunny but not subject to very strong winds which can knock the shallow rooted plants over. The soil should be well structured and rich in organic matter as sweet corn is a moderately heavy feeder.

It is an ideal crop to follow legumes or green manure in a crop rotation and will benefit from the residual nitrogen left in the soil by these plants.

Soil pH should be 6.5 and the addition of lime or dolomite prior to planting will be necessary if it is below 5.5.

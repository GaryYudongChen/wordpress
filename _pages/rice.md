 	<li><strong>Temperature</strong>: 16°C – 27°C and rainfall 100 cm to 200 cm is ideal for rice growing. But rainfall during harvest times is harmful. Annual coverage temperature around 24°C is ideal.</li>
 	<li><strong>Soil</strong>: rice is grown well on the alluvial soil or on the fertile river basins. It is also grown in mixed soil or loamy and clayey soil.</li>
 	<li><strong>Land</strong>: Plain lands or gentle slopes are suitable for the production of rice. Because stagnancy of water is a must for the cultivation of rice.</li>
